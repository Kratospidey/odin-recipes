    <h2>Steps</h2>

      <li>
        <p>
          Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over
          medium heat until well browned. Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato
          sauce, tomato paste, and water. Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons
          parsley, basil, 1 teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and
          pepper. Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna
          noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse
          with cold water. In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg,
          remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li><p>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</p></li>
      <li>
        <p>
          To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a
          9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce.
          Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of the
          mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella,
          and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. Repeat layers, and top with
          remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent
          sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray or make sure the foil
          does not touch the cheese.
        </p>
      </li>

        <p>
          Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake
          for an additional 25 minutes. Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before
          serving.
